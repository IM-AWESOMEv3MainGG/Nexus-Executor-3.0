# What do I do with bussing-assets.zip?
Unzip it. If it doesnt work, try downloading either WinRAR or 7-Zip. I would reccomend 7-Zip
# How to run?
Run the bootstrapper, and then you should see a MediaFire file pop up. This may seem sketchy, but it's the most I can do.
If it doesnt automatically download, press the download button. Now, you can run Nexus!
